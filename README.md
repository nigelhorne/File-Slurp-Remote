# NAME

    File::Slurp::Remote - read/write files on remote systems using ssh.

# SYNOPSIS

    use File::Slurp::Remote;

    write_remote_file($host, $file, @contents);

    @lines = read_remote_file($host, $file);

    $whole_thing = read_remote_file($host, $file);

# DESCRIPTION

This is similar to [File::Slurp](https://metacpan.org/pod/File%3A%3ASlurp), but it reads and writes files on
remote systems using `ssh` to get there.

It uses ssh/scp to get to the remote systems.  You can override the copy
command by redefining `$File::Slurp::Remote::scp`.  You can override
the remote shell command by redefining
`$File::Slurp::Remote::SmartOpen::ssh`.
